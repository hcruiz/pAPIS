The [Adaptive Path-Integral Smoother](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00278) is a latent process sampler targeting the posterior distribution over a continuous-time state-space model given a time series. The algorithm is based on the path integral control theory. For more detail on the theory see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505066).
In what follows, I will give a short description of the algorithm and the modules. This is description is work in progress, so if you have questions or feedback I will very much appreciate if you drop me a line.
